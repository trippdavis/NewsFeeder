It failed to translate into more seats in parliament, but made Clegg viable as the deputy prime minister he then became. Ever since, it\\u0026#8217;s been bittersweet for the Lib Dem leader.

But the style of debating they\\u0026#8217;re used to doesn’t come across well on screen. \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2015/jan/19/are-prime-ministers-questions-past-sell-by-date-as-nick-clegg-argues\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EPrime Minister’s Questions\\u003C/a\\u003E is an arcane institution in which members of parliament gather every Wednesday lunchtime to perch or slouch on the green leather seats of the House of Commons, and shout at each other.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere have been calls from many quarters to do away with the “\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a622441/nick-clegg-calls-for-prime-ministers-questions-axe-its-a-farce.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Efarce\\u003C/a\\u003E,” which features aggressive and supremely old-fashioned insult-flinging, shouts of “shame!” and calls for “order, order.” It would be funny to watch if it wasn’t so boring, and didn’t represent the public face of British democracy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn the latest round of television pre-election events, only one of which—tonight’s—is actually a debate in which politicians respond to one another, broadcasters are trying to do better. Both last week’s Channel 4/Sky program and tonight’s debate have a studio audience posing questions to the leaders. In last week\\u0026#8217;s, Jeremy Paxman, a career-griller of politicians, put Cameron and then Ed Milliband, the Labour leader, through their paces.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut the effect was hollow. Both leaders, intent on not slipping up, stuck doggedly to the party line and trotted out a stream of stats to back up their arguments. They thanked the audience for questions, re-phrased them to change the meaning, and gave answers that sounded pre-prepared. This wasn’t a conversation, but a performance of listening, and a parody of communication.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMaybe I, a British person unused to televised debate, am hoping for more than this limited format can offer. But I think most of us are watching not to hear a party line one more time, or even catch a stumble. We’re hoping to see something of the real person—to look into the leaders’ eyes, as much as many of us ever can do, and judge them on ineffable qualities like truthfulness and the ability to lead.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003EThe medium is the message\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHeads of the seven political parties taking part in tonight’s debate will today, like this Quartz reporter, be en route to Salford in Greater Manchester, whence much of the country’s media has decamped in recent years both to economize and to decentralize away from London.

Nick Clegg, likely white knuckled but perhaps with little to lose, comes next. After him is Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party.

Less surprisingly, the Pentagon’s count also excludes secret (or secretive) American bases, like those reported in Israel and Saudi Arabia.

These toxins also impair the immune system and stunt children’s growth.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPre- and post-harvest aflatoxin mitigation strategies, as well as dietary additives to bind ingestion aflatoxin, are often expensive and unsustainable. However, in Qidong, China, a former aflatoxin “hotspot,” 1 in 10 men succumbed to liver cancer by age 45 prior to market reforms of the 1980s.  Following increased trade with neighboring counties, residents of Qidong replaced corn with rice in the diet, and the liver cancer mortality rate was nearly cut in half over the next 30 years. This finding demonstrated that changing the diet to include foods that contain lower toxin levels may substantially improve public health.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDiet diversification not only reduces intake of these toxins but may also provide nutrients that counteract the negative affects of the toxin. This is likely to be the case in communities that consume large amounts of bitter cassava. Adhering to traditional preparation methods of sun drying and/or soaking cassava for 2-3 days reduces cyanogenic glycosides to safe levels.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EChildren are often at highest risk from adverse health effects.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWithout proper preparation, which occurs during food shortages, cassava cyanide can cause neurocognitive and neuromuscular problems, including a condition of permanent paralysis called “konzo.” Increasing dietary sulfur amino acids, which aid in cyanide detoxification in the body, reduces the risk of konzo. A diverse diet less dependent on cassava and richer in sulfur amino acids found in eggs, dairy, meat and legumes can reduce cyanide poisoning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPromoting nutritional diversity, thus reducing toxin exposure and counteracting toxicity, is easier said than done.

There need to be changes to food policy, public health and education programs for farmers that encourage greater diversity of foods in diets, and reduce the proportion of foods that are known to contain naturally occurring toxins.

The actively disengaged group, meanwhile, can cost the US economy close to $400 billion per year. So not only are employees walking out the door because their bosses can\\u0026#8217;t or won\\u0026#8217;t engage them, but it also leaves a whole lot of money on the table.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026#8220;Engagement is strongly connected to business outcomes that are essential to an organization’s financial success, including productivity, profitability and customer ratings,\\u0026#8221; the report said. \\u0026#8220;And engaged employees are the ones who are the most likely to drive the innovation, growth and revenue that their companies desperately need.\\u0026#8221;\\u003Cb\\u003E \\u003C/b\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2013/03/4-reasons-why-investing-employee-engagement-matters/62098/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003EOther recent reports\\u003C/a\\u003E corroborate Gallup\\u0026#8217;s conclusions: US federal agencies lose $65 billion per year from lost productivity alone, according to Deloitte.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf there\\u0026#8217;s any type of silver lining, it\\u0026#8217;s that this lack of engagement is really only coming from one sex: Yes, you guessed it, men.

But American opponents of the Iranian regime are still likely to assail the agreement, in particular a clause that provides a broad timetable for a lifting of all sanctions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIran for the first time agreed, concretely, to reduce the number of its uranium-enriching centrifuges from the current 19,000 to somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000; to allow strict international oversight for a decade; and to either dilute its current stock of highly enriched uranium or ship it abroad.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen the agreements are implemented, and verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency, all oil and financial sanctions on Iran will be lifted, according to a statement read this evening (April 2) from Lausanne, Switzerland, where the talks were held.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe detail in the statement—listing limitations on specific enrichment facilities, for example—is surprising. And it suggests that, against Iran’s long insistence that it was not prepared to talk specifics at this time, it bent in the final few hours of an eight-day, marathon negotiating session. Previously, Iran\\u0026#8217;s negotiators had stuck to a strategy stated by supreme leader Ali Khamenei, which was to seek a single, all-encompassing agreement to be announced June 30. Such a shift in strategy would only be possible if Khamenei himself instructed his team to make it, a signal from Tehran that must have been passed early this morning.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EBrent crude oil prices fell more than 4.9% to $54.28 a barrel, suggesting the market is taking the preliminary deal seriously.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe question now will be whether the US Congress is prepared to trust that the preliminary accord merits holding off on new sanctions against Tehran.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere is reason to believe that president Barack Obama will have a tough time persuading Congress to hold fire: Khamenei’s calculus has seemed to underestimate the resolve of a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thehill.com/policy/defense/237411-senate-dem-warns-sanctions-if-no-iran-deal\\\"\\u003Epossibly veto-proof\\u003C/a\\u003E congressional majority to impose harsher oil and financial sanctions in the absence of a breakthrough this week. Congress may inform Khamenei of this reality when it reconvenes in a couple of weeks, and perhaps makes more severe sanctions \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/29/politics/boehner-iran-sanctions/\\\"\\u003Eone of its first orders of business\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe issues right now are fairly clear-cut—the international side, called P5+1, wanted Iran to agree on paper to 15 years or so of restrictions on its capacity to create highly enriched uranium, and on its plans to both build and conduct research on more advanced nuclear technologies. Iran, meanwhile, has demanded fewer restrictions, covering a shorter period of time, and wants all oil and financial sanctions to be lifted immediately. As described, the tentative accord seems to cut the deal somewhere in the middle of the two.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe rush by P5+1 to get something down on paper was entirely driven by American politics—a large, bipartisan well in the House and Senate, suspicious of Iran’s sincerity and trustworthiness, is keen to punish Tehran for not caving in more quickly. This urgency was criticized by France and others who said it played into Tehran’s hands, giving Iran another negotiating ace when it is in no hurry at all. Such critics may rightly look at American politics as a bizarre, small-time game of lots of hot air and a shortage of statesmanlike policy.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs the negotiations enter their final phase, Iran may watch the stakes go up, mainly because of its own taste for brinksmanship. In the absence of a tangible, finalized deal, Congress is as likely as not to impose harsher sanctions, to be triggered right around July 1.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=375584\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/375584/iran-has-blinked-bringing-negotiators-to-a-preliminary-agreement-on-a-nuclear-deal/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-04-02T11:31:42-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=375584\",\"dc_creator\":\"Steve LeVine\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/irantalks.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"irantalks\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/irantalks.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/375584/iran-has-blinked-bringing-negotiators-to-a-preliminary-agreement-on-a-nuclear-deal/"], ["published_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 18:31:42 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Iran has blinked, bringing negotiators to a preliminary agreement on a nuclear deal"], ["updated_at", Thu, 02 Apr 2015 18:46:19 UTC +00:00]]

Wilson, forensic psychologists at the University of Liverpool, in a 2013 analysis for the \\u003Cem\\u003EJournal of Police and Criminal Psychology\\u003C/em\\u003E. “Attacks on these targets evoke a strong emotional response.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Schools and other educational institutions represent ‘soft targets,’” they added. “A soft target is a relatively unguarded site where people congregate, normally in large numbers, thus offering the potential for mass casualties.” But practicalities aside, there are also specific, political and cultural reasons a terrorist cell might target a school or university. And this is where such acts diverge from the usual modes of modern terror.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough bombing public transport takes months, if not years of intensive planning, it is intended to make the act appear random—anyone could become a victim by passing through at the wrong time. The terrifying power of this particular terror tactic is, after all, its unpredictability.

It is also a highly diverse place, with regards to religion and ethnicity, not unlike many African countries occupying the borderlands between Muslim-dominated North Africa and the Christian-dominated south. Consequently, Kenyan schools and universities are well-positioned for the maximal exchange of cultures, politics, and ideas—a concept that stands in direct opposition to the rigid ideologies of groups like al-Shabab.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAl-Shabab has a history of interfering in local education. In areas of Somalia under the group’s control, once co-ed schools have been gender segregated, with the majority of girls \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/1806/Al-Shabaab_Devastates_Education_for_Kids\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ebeing intimidated against enrolling\\u003C/a\\u003E, if not forcibly removed from schools all together.
